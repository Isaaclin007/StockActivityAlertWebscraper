When a stock breaks it's 5 day support or resistance from a list of tickers I'm interested in, a text message is sent to my phone over SMS.

There are two ways to try out this code.

option 1: download the ipynb file and open it in google collab, then run it there.

option 2: download the py file and then download all the necessary dependancies (Selenium, TextMagic API, Pandas, Numpy, etc. (shown with '!' at top of code).

To actually send a text magic over SMS you will need to create free trial account with TextMagic API, I don't want to share my account info (plus my trial expires in a week).
